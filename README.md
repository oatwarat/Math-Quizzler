## Description
### Math Quizzler contains 10 math questions, each of which is randomized. The application also keeps track of your score and progress bar throughout the quiz. Additionally, it provides a restart button if the user wants to try again with a brand new set of randomized questions.

## Design Pattern
### In this application, we implement the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.
